AC-MLib: Algorithmic Composition Library for SuperCollider.
Objects to be loaded as extensions to use with the SuperCollider language. 

This library I am working on is going to contain implementations of UI tools that 
allows for easier interaction and organisation with Patterns and tactile interfaces 
like the PadKontrol in native mode and the Lemur app. Also I will add Pattern classes 
and UGens that I implemented to use with Algorithmic Composition. 

What I have added until now:
- Stochastic number generators as Demand UGens.
- Lemur class to build elementary elements realtime on the Ipad app.
- Some patterns classes: tools and number generators. 
- Test physical modeling UGens like a gravity oscillator.
